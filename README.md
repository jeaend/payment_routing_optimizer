# 💳 **Payment Routing Optimizer**  

## 📝 **Overview**  
Develop a machine learning model to optimize the routing of credit card transactions to Payment Service Providers (PSPs). The goal is to minimize transaction fees, reduce failures, and maximize success rates by leveraging predictive modeling and cost optimization strategies.  

---

## 🎯 **Use Case**  
This project focuses on enhancing the efficiency of credit card transaction routing. The specific objectives include:  
- **Predictive Modeling:** Create a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of transaction success for each PSP.  
- **Cost Optimization:** Design a decision framework to select the most cost-efficient PSP for each transaction while maintaining high success rates.  

---

## 📦 **Deliverables**  

### **1. Predictive Model**  
A machine learning model that evaluates the likelihood of transaction success for each PSP, taking into account transaction features such as:  
- Amount, country, and timestamp.  
- PSP-specific characteristics (fees and historical performance).  

### **2. Optimal Routing Strategy**  
A decision-making framework that:  
- Selects the PSP with the highest predicted success probability and the lowest associated fees.  
- Incorporates business rules, such as consolidating multiple transaction attempts.  

### **3. Evaluation Metrics**  
Key metrics to assess the performance of the predictive model and routing strategy include:  
- **Cost Savings:** Reduction in transaction fees compared to baseline routing methods.  
- **Success Rate Improvement:** Increase in successful transactions achieved by the model.
